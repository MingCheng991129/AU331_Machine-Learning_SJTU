This folder contains the second personal homework of AU331:
- use pytorch to implement a three-layer network and test on iris data.
- use pytorch to design a deep neural network and test on MNIST data.
- use numpy(only) to implement a three-layer network and test on iris data.

As for subproblem one, I implement torch_iris_relu.py, in which relu is used as active function. Also, you can use other active functions.

As for subproblem two, I implement mnist.py.

As for subproblem three, I implement np_getdata.py, np_model.py and np_iris.py. The first file is to load and preprocess the iris data. The second one is to implement my model using numpy only. The last one is to train my model on iris dataset.

Homework 3 includes:
- use **numpy** only to implement MDS Algorithm and test it on MNIST12(only with label 1 and 2)
- use **numpy** only to implement Cluster Algorithm using Euclidean distance and Ncut as methods of measurement, respectively. Then test it on data
*watermelon3.0*
- use **numpy** only to implement a decision tree based on **information gain** and test it on data *watermelon 3.0*
